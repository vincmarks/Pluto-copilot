# Pluto-copilot

In this template, you'll find an example of how to integrate a LLM into your Pluto notebook using [``OpenAI.jl``](https://github.com/JuliaML/OpenAI.jl). In addition to querying individual cells, the notebook also supports global questions related to the entire notebook. Furthermore, there's a feature that allows you to enter keywords and receive Copilot-style suggestions for what to write next.
